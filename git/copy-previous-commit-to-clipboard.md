## Copying your previous git commit to clipboard

Ever find yourself committing a change thatâ€™s almost *exactly* the same as your previous commit to a git repo, but different enough to warrant its own commit?  

The following code snippet copies your last commit message to clipboard, so you can paste it a second time, tweak slightly, and commit :heart:

```ruby
git log -1 --pretty=%H | pbcopy
```

This command works beautifully on MacOS. If `pbcopy` isn't available on your operating system, you may need to tweak the snippet slightly to work with your system clipboard.

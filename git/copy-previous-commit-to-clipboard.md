## Copying your previous git commit to clipboard

Ever find yourself committing a change thatâ€™s almost *exactly* the same as your previous commit to a git repo, but different enough to warrant its own commit?  

The following code snippet copies your last commit message to clipboard, so you can paste it a second time, tweak slightly, and commit :heart:

```ruby
git log -1 --pretty=%B | pbcopy
```

## Paste and match style

Sometimes, you'll copy text from a web page (for example) in OS X and it'll helpfully bring the formatting with it when you paste it. This is very rarely what you want. Happy days arrive when you discover the `Paste and Match Style` command in the `Edit` menu, along with its keyboard shortcut, `<option>`+`<shift>`+`<command>`+`v`.

Great as this is, it can be frustrating to have to remember the separate command. Couldn't `<command>`+`v` just do the right thing?

Friends, I have good news.

## Good news

- Launch System Preferences
- Select the Shortcuts tab
- Select App Shortcuts from the sidebar
- Click the + button to add a new shortcut
- Ensuring Application is set to "All Applications", enter "Paste and Match Style" (case is important!) in Menu title
- Click into Keyboard Shortcut and hit `<command>`+`v`
- Click Add

Now try copying and pasting some formatted text.

_You're welcome_.

# Copy, Cut, and Paste in Trello

## Copy a Card
1. Hover over a card
2. Press `cmd` + `c`
3. Move to another list or board and hover over `Add another card` or the gap between two cards.
4. Press `cmd` + `v`

A copy of that card is then added to the end of the list.

## Move a Card
1. Hover over a card
2. Press `cmd` + `x`
3. Move to another list or board and hover over `Add another card` or the gap between two cards.
4. Press `cmd` + `v`

The card will then be removed from it's previous position and added to the end of the current list.

## Bonus Tip
If you copy a card and then hover over another card and paste it will add a link to the card youâ€™re copying to the card your pasting onto! :tada:

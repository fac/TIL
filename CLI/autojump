# Autojump

Autojump, which can be installed with `brew install autojump`, is a simple utility that lets you navigate directories on the command line faster than `cd`. Call it with the name of a directory you've visited in the past and it'll take you there. It works off the shell history so you need to have visited a directory before.

## Examples

`j fre` takes me to `~/dev/freeagent`.

I actually have the app checked out in `~/dev/freeagent/freeagent`. If I want to jump straight here I can use `j fr fr`.

Once there, `jc m` takes me to `app/models`. (`jc` looks for child directories of the current directory).

You can also use `jo fr` to open (in my case) `~/dev/freeagent` in a Finder window.
